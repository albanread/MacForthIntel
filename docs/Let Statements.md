# LET Statements in ForthJIT

## Overview of `LET`

The `LET` construct is an extension in ForthJIT that allows you to define infix numerical functions that calculate floating point values.

### **Key Features of `LET`**
1. **Constant Inputs**: The inputs to the function remain constant throughout its evaluation.
2. **Stepwise Logic**: Use `WHERE` statements to define intermediate values step-by-step before arriving at the final results.
3. **Modular Design**: `LET` enables breaking down a calculation into smaller, logical steps, improving readability and maintainability.

## Syntax of `LET`
### **Structure**
``` forth
: FunctionName 
    LET (result1, result2, ...) = FN(arg1, arg2, ...) = 
        expression, expression, ...
        WHERE intermediate1 = expression1
        WHERE intermediate2 = expression2
        ...
        WHERE result1 = expression3 ;
```
- **Function Name**: The name of the function being defined.
- **Results**: Output values (`result1`, `result2`, ...).
- **Inputs**: Original constants passed as arguments (`arg1`, `arg2`, ...).
- **Intermediate Values**: Declared in `WHERE` statements to build upon earlier results or inputs.
- **Logical Flow**: Each `WHERE` statements are evaluated in dependency order, but you cant have circular dependencies.

## Examples Using `LET`
Below are detailed examples to demonstrate the best practices for writing `LET` statements.

### Example 1: Calculating Area of a Circle
**Purpose**: Compute the area of a circle given the radius.

``` forth
: area
     LET (area) = FN(radius) = pi * pow( radius, 2 ) 
        WHERE pi = 3.141592653589793; 
```
**Usage**:
``` forth
1.0 area f.
```
**Output**:
`3.141592653589793`

### Example 2: Calculating Building Height
**Purpose**: Compute the height of a building given the shadow length and the angle of elevation in degrees.
``` forth

```
**Usage**:
``` forth
10. 45. building_height f.
```
**Output**:
`10.0`
### Example 3: Calculating Sine Wave Position
**Purpose**: Compute the position of a sine wave given amplitude, frequency, and time.
``` forth
: sine_wave_p 
    LET (position) = FN(amplitude, frequency, time) = amplitude * sin(2 * pi * frequency * time) 
       WHERE pi = 3.141592653589793 ;
```
**Usage**:
``` forth
3.0 2.0 0.125 sine_wave_p f.
```
**Output**:
`3.0`
### Example 4: Calculating Distance Between Two Points
**Purpose**: Compute the Euclidean distance between two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`.
``` forth
: point_distance
    LET (distance) = FN(x1, y1, x2, y2) = hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1) ;
```
**Usage**:
``` forth
100. 100. 200. 200. point_distance f.
```
**Output**:
`141.42`
### Example 5: Mandelbrot Iteration (`M2`)
**Purpose**: Iterate values for a step in the Mandelbrot set calculation to compute the next complex value `(z_next_re, z_next_im)` and its magnitude.
``` forth
: mbrot LET 
    (z_next_re, z_next_im, mag) = FN(z_re, z_im, x, y) =
    re, im, rmag
    WHERE re = (z_re * z_re) - (z_im * z_im) + x       
    WHERE im = (2 * z_re * z_im) + y       
    WHERE rmag = (re * re) + (im * im) ;                
```
**Usage**:
``` forth
1. 1. 1. 1. mbrot f. f. f.
```
**Output**:
`1 3 10`

## Best Practices for Writing `LET` Statements
1. **Keep Definitions Modular**: Break the calculation into smaller, logical steps using `WHERE` statements to define intermediate values explicitly.
2. **Avoid Repetition**: Use intermediate values to avoid recalculating the same expression multiple times.
3. **Use Meaningful Names**: Use self-explanatory names for inputs, intermediate values, and results to improve readability.
4. **Validate Intermediate Steps**: Check that each `WHERE` statement produces expected results before combining them in subsequent calculations.

## Common "Gotchas" for `LET`
1. **Confusing Intermediate Values with Inputs**: Inputs (`arg1`, `arg2`, etc.) are constants, and intermediate values must be declared explicitly using `WHERE` if you want to modify or extend calculations.
2. **Reusing Variable Names**: Avoid reusing names from inputs or prior variables.

## Why?

This ForthJit compiler is nice and simple, so while ForthJit can do floating point maths, it will produce quite low density code.

The expression evaluator is its own compiler, it has a simple syntax, and follows rules that should make it easier to generate faster numeric functions.


: rotate_point_2d
    LET (xr, yr) = FN(x, y, theta) = 
    x * cos(theta) - y * sin(theta),
    x * sin(theta_radians) + y * cos(theta_radians);
